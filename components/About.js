          Hi, My name is Matt, I'm a self-taught Front-End devloper. <br />
          <br />
          Learning to code has been an enjoyable and rewarding experience. I Now
          feel at a point where I can build multipage websites with my HTML &
          CSS skills. I have also spent time learning and practicing JavaScript
          (including working with API's), functional programming and object
          oriented programming. <br />
          <br /> I am aware that this is a fast growing industry, therefore I
          make sure to learn and use frameworks and tools such as React,
          Tailwind and next js. <br />
          <br /> I am a developer because I enjoy creating and i'm inspired to
          be a better me today than I was yesterday.
